#when we given more than the limit then it shows 'stop iteration'.
#when we are working with "databases",let it woukd have 1000's of 
data in databse.when if we want to retrive data from the data base
'generators play a major role'.Because it continues were it stops.
########diff of return and yield############
#RETURN:The Keyword return returns a value from a function,at which time the
func. then loses its local state.Thus,the next time we call that func,
it starts over from its first statement.
######
#YIELD:yield maintains a state between function calls, and resumes from where it 
it ;left off, when we call the next() method again.
so, yield is called in the generator, then the next time the same generator is 
called we'll pick right back up after the last yield statement.
