An iterator is an object which has __next()__ method.
which means every time you ask for the next value, an iterator knows how to compute it
it keeps the info. about the current state of iterable it is working on.
The iterator calls the next value when you call next() on it.
An object that uses the __next()__ method is ultimately an iterator.
**iterator help to produce cleaner looking code because they allows us to work with infinite
sequences without re-allocating resources for every possible sequence, thus also saving resource
space.
**python has the several built-in objects:lists,tuples,strings,dictionaries and even files.
#think of a website i have a python course in my website.
#it has a list of values(iterables). when i load it into the website, the iterator comes into
picture when i click on next button  then it goes into the other file insted of loading it.
